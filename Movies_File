# Imagine we have a list of tuples, each of which holds a string and two integers: a movie's title, its gross (in millions of dollars),
# and its release year.Here's a declaration of a short example of this kind of list:
# movieList = [('Rasee', 530, 2017), ('Sultan', 486, 2017), ('Baazar', 408, 2017)]
# Imagine we wanted to write this list to a file called Movies.txt,
# such that each line contained one such tuple. For the above list, we would want the file to read:
# ('Rasee', 530, 2017)
# ('Sultan', 486, 2017)
# ('Baazar', 408, 2017)

outputFile = open("movies.txt", "w")
for movie in movieList:
    print(movie, file = outputFile)
outputFile.close()
