# Imagine you're writing some software to run a household thermostat. 
# As part of that, you want to keep a log file, LogFile.txt, 
# that records every time the temperature setting on the thermostat changes.
# So, you decide to do this by writing a log function that takes as input a number as a float,
# and writes it to the log file.


def logChanges(newValue):
    logFile=[1]
    [2]
    [3]
# Blank #1
# Opening a file using open() method
    open("logFile.txt", 'a')
    # Blank #2
    #  specifying the mode 
    print('New temperature setting:', newValue,flie=logFile)
    # closing to file
    # blank #3
    logFile.close()

print(logChanges)
